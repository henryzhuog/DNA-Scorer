# DNA-Scorer

### Project Description
This is a Java program that scores and determines the optimal alignment of two DNA sequences; the key component of this program is the Smith-Waterman algorithm which performs the calculation in a relatively efficient fashion. These DNA sequences can be found in the provided FASTA files but you're free to download and use other compatible FASTA files from the internet if you'd like.

Many of the jargons, procedures, and computations are very arcane so feel free to look up anything that is confusing. With that said, the point of this program is to emphasize the beauty of algorithms and how proper implementations of them can greatly enhance computation (i.e. no biology background needed).

### Installing and Running
Simply download/clone the repository and run Main.java in an IDE.
